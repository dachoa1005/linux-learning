1   Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY, of the house of Capulet, armed with swords and bucklers

2   SAMPSON

3   Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.

4   GREGORY

5   No, for then we should be colliers.

6   SAMPSON

7   I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.

8   GREGORY

9   Ay, while you live, draw your neck out o' the collar.

10   SAMPSON

11   I strike quickly, being moved.

12   GREGORY

13   But thou art not quickly moved to strike.
14   SAMPSON

15   A dog of the house of Montague moves me.

16   GREGORY

17   To move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand:

18   therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away.
19   SAMPSON

20   A dog of that house shall move me to stand: I will

21   take the wall of any man or maid of Montague's.

22   GREGORY

23   That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes
24   to the wall.

25   SAMPSON

26   True; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels,

27   are ever thrust to the wall: therefore I will push
28   Montague's men from the wall, and thrust his maids

29   to the wall.

30   GREGORY

31   The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.
32   SAMPSON

33   'Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant: when I

34   have fought with the men, I will be cruel with the

35   maids, and cut off their heads.

36   GREGORY

37   The heads of the maids?
38   SAMPSON

39   Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads;

40   take it in what sense thou wilt.

41   GREGORY
42   They must take it in sense that feel it.

43   SAMPSON

44   Me they shall feel while I am able to stand: and

45   'tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh.

46   GREGORY
47   'Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou

48   hadst been poor John. Draw thy tool! here comes

49   two of the house of the Montagues.

50   SAMPSON

51   My naked weapon is out: quarrel, I will back thee.

52   GREGORY
53   How! turn thy back and run?

54   SAMPSON

55   Fear me not.

56   GREGORY

57   No, marry; I fear thee!
58   SAMPSON

59   Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.

60   GREGORY

61   I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as

62   they list.
63   SAMPSON

64   Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them;

65   which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.

66   Enter ABRAHAM and BALTHASAR


67   ABRAHAM

68   Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
69   SAMPSON

70   I do bite my thumb, sir.

71   ABRAHAM

72   Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
73   SAMPSON

74   [Aside to GREGORY] Is the law of our side, if I say

75   ay?

76   GREGORY
77   No.


78   SAMPSON
79   No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir, but I


80   bite my thumb, sir.
81   GREGORY
82   Do you quarrel, sir?
83   ABRAHAM
84   Quarrel sir! no, sir.
85   SAMPSON
86   If you do, sir, I am for you: I serve as good a man as you.
87   ABRAHAM
88   No better.
89   SAMPSON
90   Well, sir.
91   GREGORY
92   Say 'better:' here comes one of my master's kinsmen.
93   SAMPSON
94   Yes, better, sir.
95   ABRAHAM
96   You lie.
97   SAMPSON
98   Draw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy swashing blow.
99   They fight

100   Enter BENVOLIO

101   BENVOLIO
102   Part, fools!
103   Put up your swords; you know not what you do.
104   Beats down their swords

105   Enter TYBALT

106   TYBALT
107   What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?
108   Turn thee, Benvolio, look upon thy death.
109   BENVOLIO
110   I do but keep the peace: put up thy sword,
111   Or manage it to part these men with me.
112   TYBALT
113   What, drawn, and talk of peace! I hate the word,
114   As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee:
115   Have at thee, coward!
116   They fight

117   Enter, several of both houses, who join the fray; then enter Citizens, with clubs

118   First Citizen
119   Clubs, bills, and partisans! strike! beat them down!
120   Down with the Capulets! down with the Montagues!
121   Enter CAPULET in his gown, and LADY CAPULET

122   CAPULET
123   What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!
124   LADY CAPULET
125   A crutch, a crutch! why call you for a sword?
126   CAPULET
127   My sword, I say! Old Montague is come,
128   And flourishes his blade in spite of me.
129   Enter MONTAGUE and LADY MONTAGUE

130   MONTAGUE
131   Thou villain Capulet,--Hold me not, let me go.
132   LADY MONTAGUE
133   Thou shalt not stir a foot to seek a foe.
134   Enter PRINCE, with Attendants

135   PRINCE
136   Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,
137   Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel,--
138   Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts,
139   That quench the fire of your pernicious rage
140   With purple fountains issuing from your veins,
141   On pain of torture, from those bloody hands
142   Throw your mistemper'd weapons to the ground,
143   And hear the sentence of your moved prince.
144   Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,
145   By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,
146   Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets,
147   And made Verona's ancient citizens
148   Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments,
149   To wield old partisans, in hands as old,
150   Canker'd with peace, to part your canker'd hate:
151   If ever you disturb our streets again,
152   Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.
153   For this time, all the rest depart away:
154   You Capulet; shall go along with me:
155   And, Montague, come you this afternoon,
156   To know our further pleasure in this case,
157   To old Free-town, our common judgment-place.
158   Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.
159   Exeunt all but MONTAGUE, LADY MONTAGUE, and BENVOLIO

160   MONTAGUE
161   Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?
162   Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?
163   BENVOLIO
164   Here were the servants of your adversary,
165   And yours, close fighting ere I did approach:
166   I drew to part them: in the instant came
167   The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepared,
168   Which, as he breathed defiance to my ears,
169   He swung about his head and cut the winds,
170   Who nothing hurt withal hiss'd him in scorn:
171   While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,
172   Came more and more and fought on part and part,
173   Till the prince came, who parted either part.
174   LADY MONTAGUE
175   O, where is Romeo? saw you him to-day?
176   Right glad I am he was not at this fray.
177   BENVOLIO
178   Madam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun
179   Peer'd forth the golden window of the east,
180   A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;
181   Where, underneath the grove of sycamore
182   That westward rooteth from the city's side,
183   So early walking did I see your son:
184   Towards him I made, but he was ware of me
185   And stole into the covert of the wood:
186   I, measuring his affections by my own,
187   That most are busied when they're most alone,
188   Pursued my humour not pursuing his,
189   And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me.
190   MONTAGUE
191   Many a morning hath he there been seen,
192   With tears augmenting the fresh morning dew.
193   Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;
194   But all so soon as the all-cheering sun
195   Should in the furthest east begin to draw
196   The shady curtains from Aurora's bed,
197   Away from the light steals home my heavy son,
198   And private in his chamber pens himself,
199   Shuts up his windows, locks far daylight out
200   And makes himself an artificial night:
201   Black and portentous must this humour prove,
202   Unless good counsel may the cause remove.
203   BENVOLIO
204   My noble uncle, do you know the cause?
205   MONTAGUE
206   I neither know it nor can learn of him.
207   BENVOLIO
208   Have you importuned him by any means?
209   MONTAGUE
210   Both by myself and many other friends:
211   But he, his own affections' counsellor,
212   Is to himself--I will not say how true--
213   But to himself so secret and so close,
214   So far from sounding and discovery,
215   As is the bud bit with an envious worm,
216   Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,
217   Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.
218   Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow.
219   We would as willingly give cure as know.
220   Enter ROMEO

221   BENVOLIO
222   See, where he comes: so please you, step aside;
223   I'll know his grievance, or be much denied.
224   MONTAGUE
225   I would thou wert so happy by thy stay,
226   To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let's away.
227   Exeunt MONTAGUE and LADY MONTAGUE

228   BENVOLIO
229   Good-morrow, cousin.
230   ROMEO
231   Is the day so young?
232   BENVOLIO
233   But new struck nine.
234   ROMEO
235   Ay me! sad hours seem long.
236   Was that my father that went hence so fast?
237   BENVOLIO
238   It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?
239   ROMEO
240   Not having that, which, having, makes them short.
241   BENVOLIO
242   In love?
243   ROMEO
244   Out--
245   BENVOLIO
246   Of love?
247   ROMEO
248   Out of her favour, where I am in love.
249   BENVOLIO
250   Alas, that love, so gentle in his view,
251   Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!
252   ROMEO
253   Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still,
254   Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will!
255   Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?
256   Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.
257   Here's much to do with hate, but more with love.
258   Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate!
259   O any thing, of nothing first create!
260   O heavy lightness! serious vanity!
261   Mis-shapen chaos of well-seeming forms!
262   Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire,
263   sick health!
264   Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!
265   This love feel I, that feel no love in this.
266   Dost thou not laugh?
267   BENVOLIO
268   No, coz, I rather weep.
269   ROMEO
270   Good heart, at what?
271   BENVOLIO
272   At thy good heart's oppression.
273   ROMEO
274   Why, such is love's transgression.
275   Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,
276   Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest
277   With more of thine: this love that thou hast shown
278   Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.
279   Love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs;
280   Being purged, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;
281   Being vex'd a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears:
282   What is it else? a madness most discreet,
283   A choking gall and a preserving sweet.
284   Farewell, my coz.
285   BENVOLIO
286   Soft! I will go along;
287   An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.
288   ROMEO
289   Tut, I have lost myself; I am not here;
290   This is not Romeo, he's some other where.
291   BENVOLIO
292   Tell me in sadness, who is that you love.
293   ROMEO
294   What, shall I groan and tell thee?
295   BENVOLIO
296   Groan! why, no.
297   But sadly tell me who.
298   ROMEO
299   Bid a sick man in sadness make his will:
300   Ah, word ill urged to one that is so ill!
301   In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
302   BENVOLIO
303   I aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved.
304   ROMEO
305   A right good mark-man! And she's fair I love.
306   BENVOLIO
307   A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.
308   ROMEO
309   Well, in that hit you miss: she'll not be hit
310   With Cupid's arrow; she hath Dian's wit;
311   And, in strong proof of chastity well arm'd,
312   From love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd.
313   She will not stay the siege of loving terms,
314   Nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes,
315   Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold:
316   O, she is rich in beauty, only poor,
317   That when she dies with beauty dies her store.
318   BENVOLIO
319   Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
320   ROMEO
321   She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste,
322   For beauty starved with her severity
323   Cuts beauty off from all posterity.
324   She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,
325   To merit bliss by making me despair:
326   She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow
327   Do I live dead that live to tell it now.
328   BENVOLIO
329   Be ruled by me, forget to think of her.
330   ROMEO
331   O, teach me how I should forget to think.
332   BENVOLIO
333   By giving liberty unto thine eyes;
334   Examine other beauties.
335   ROMEO
336   'Tis the way
337   To call hers exquisite, in question more:
338   These happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows
339   Being black put us in mind they hide the fair;
340   He that is strucken blind cannot forget
341   The precious treasure of his eyesight lost:
342   Show me a mistress that is passing fair,
343   What doth her beauty serve, but as a note
344   Where I may read who pass'd that passing fair?
345   Farewell: thou canst not teach me to forget.
346   BENVOLIO
347   I'll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.
348   Exeunt
